# P2000T software preservation

Preservation of Philips' P2000T home computer software, originating from cartridges, mini-cassettes and JWS-dos disks.

In this repo you can find:

* [Cartridge dumps](/cartridges/)
* [Programs and games](/tapes/) ripped from mini-cassettes and JWS-dos disks. Note that most P2000T games were clones of existing games from the arcade or other systems. E.g. Ghosthunt = Pac-man, Brick Wall = Breakout, Lazy Bug = Lady Bug, Macho Man = Jumping Jack/Leggit!, Fraxxon = Galaga.
* [P2000T emulators](/emulators/) for MSDOS and Windows
* [Utilities](/utilities/) for ripping P2000T cassette programs to PC, but also for loading P2000T programs from PC back to your P2000T again. Note: these utilities require a serial connection cable.
