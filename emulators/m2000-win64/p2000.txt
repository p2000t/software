This document describes the architecture of the P2000, a home computer
from the late 70ies/early 80ies that was extremely popular in Holland.
Please note that the information in this document is far from complete,
more information may be added in later releases. If anyone is able to

History
=======
1.1  Added keyboard layout specs
1.0  Initial release

There are two models of the P2000 home computer: An M-model and a T-model.
The T-model interfaces with a standard colour or black/white television
set, whereas the M-model interfaces to a monochrome monitor. The main
difference between the two models is found in the video generation.

General Architecture
====================

CPU
---
The P2000 uses a Zilog Z80 microprocessor running at 2.5MHz

Memories
--------
These memory areas are available:
  A 4K8 monitor ROM, which contains the general I/O routines such as the
start routine, the keyboard scan routine, cassette interfacing routines, a
routine to activate the bell, etc.
  An application program stored in the program cartridge. This cartridge
is inserted onto the CPU board via a slot on the machine. Various programs
are available, such as BASIC, Word-processing, etc. The application
program's memory can go up to 16K8
  8 dynamic memory chips of 16K1 form the system RAM. Part of it is
reserved for communication between the application program and the monitor
routines, the other part is available for use by the application program.
  The video memory is different for the T- and M- versions. For the T-
version, it is a 2K8 area. It includes the control characters of the
teletext character set, while cursor information is also stored there.
80x24 characters can be stored in the first 1920 characters, though only
40x24 characters are displayed at one time. A scroll register is available
for scrolling another 40 characters. For the M-version, it consists of two
areas: An 2K8 area is used to store the 80x24 characters to be displayed.
Another area of 2K4 is used to store the attributes of the characters to
be displayed, such as underline, blinking and inverse video.
  Two more 16K8 dynamic RAM areas can be stored on the extension board.
The upper 8K of this area cannot be accessed directly by the CPU and is
especially used by disc systems to store part of the operating system.

I/O control
-----------
Input and output to external devices is done via I/O ports. Among others,
ports are available for scanning the keyboard matrix, serial I/O, the
cassette interface, the beep and the floppy-controller.

Interrupts
----------
When the extension board is not used, interrupts are generated via a
circuitry on the CPU-board, giving an interrupt every 20ms to scan the key
matrix.
When the extension board is used, interrupts are controlled by a
programmable interrupt controller providing interrupt addresses for the
floppy and the keyboard.

Memory layout
=============
Memory layout is as follows:
0000-0FFF  Monitor ROM
1000-4FFF  Application program
5000-57FF  Video RAM (T-version)
5000-5FFF  Video RAM (M-version)
6000-9FFF  System RAM
A000-FFFF  Extension board

I/O layout
==========
00-09 Keyboard port
      If the keyboard interrupt is enabled, all keyboard matrix rows are
      connected and reading from either of these ports will give the
      keyboard status (FF=no key pressed)
      If the keyboard interrupt is disables, reading one of these ports
      will read the corresponding keyboard matrix row
10-1F Output port
      Bit  Function
      0    Cassette write data
      1    Cassette write command
      2    Cassette rewind
      3    Cassette forward
      4    Unused
      5    Unused
      6    Keyboard interrupt enable
      7    Printer output
20-2F Input port
      Bit  Function
      0    Printer input
      1    Printer ready
      2    Strap N (Daisy/Matrix)
      3    Cassette write enabled
      4    Cassette in position
      5    Begin/End of tape
      6    Cassette read clock
      7    Cassette read data
      The read data is a serial bit pattern in phase encoded format. Read
      clock is active at the start of every new bit
30-3F Scroll register (T-version only)
      The lower 7 bits of this register hold the index of the first
      character to be displayed
      The upper bit can be used to turn video display on/off (0=display
      enabled)
50-5F Beeper
      Setting bit 0 of this register will turn on the beeper
70-7F DISAS (M-version only)
      The DISA is activated by setting bit 1 of this register. When the
      DISA is active, the CPU has the highest priority and video refresh
      is disabled when the CPU accesses video memory

Keys marked with an asterix (*) are on the numeric keypad

Video processor
===============
The video processor used in the T-model is the SAA5050 teletext character
generator. In some versions, it is replaced with a variant with a
different character set (e.g. SAA5051 has a German character set). It
generates 96 alphanumeric and 64 graphics characters. In addition, there
are 32 control characters which determine the nature of display. It's
basic input is the 7-bit character data from the teletext page memory.
Following are the control codes supported by this device:
00  Unused                            10  Unused
01  Alpha Red                         11  Graphics Red
